Question 2:The given code has a base class charInput, it has member methods add() and getvalue(). The class numInput inherits charInput. You need to implement:add(): it should be inside charInput, this adds the given character to the current value
getValue(): it should be inside numInput, it returns the current value add(): it should be inside numInput, this must override the base class method so that each non-numeric char is ignored.
Question 3:You have a binary string with length N. You are allowed to do swap() operations of two elements only if the index parity of both elements is the same. This means that: you can swap() an element at index 2, with any element at index4, 6, 8 etc. (even parity), similarly the element at index 3 can be
swapped with the element at index1, 5,7,9 etc.
Question 7:Write a c++ program, this will take two input values for length and breadth of a chocolate bar.
You will get more money if you sell the chocolate in square shapes. So, you would try to divide the chocolate into minimum possible number of square pieces, such that each piece has the same area and
the piece divide the chocolate bar (original big bar) perfectly. Note that this will give you most profit for the entire bar.
